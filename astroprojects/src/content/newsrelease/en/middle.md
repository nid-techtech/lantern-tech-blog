# Shape Writer

'See' the flow of information

# Theme: Flow of Information

We typically perceive data only through its end results—receiving or storing it—and rarely visualize the process by which data is transmitted through prioritization or networks.

When saving data from a PC to an HDD, that data must be physically moving as electrical signals within this cable.

Shape Writer attempts to visually represent this flow of data.

# Operation

1. Alphabets are extruded based on input
2. Accumulate in the collection cartridge
3. Flow along the conveyor
4. Are stored

You can observe the input information “flowing.”

# Configuration

- Input Unit
- Cartridge Unit
- Conveyor Unit
- Storage Tank Unit

# Cartridge

Using a servo motor, it pushes out the alphabet letters stacked by the extrusion mechanism one position character at a time.

One is prepared for each type of character.

# Appendix

Since the “send” function is primary, no restore feature is added to the information storage section.

**Installation appeal**

- Participants can only perceive information as a tangible form when characters appear on the conveyor (the UI also disappears when Enter is pressed)
- You can tell someone typed characters before (though you don't know what they were)

Characters accumulate in the box

Might be interesting like a “capacity” gauge.

**Visual Interpretation**

Loading UI inspired by progress bars during data transfer

Characters are the information itself

Characters as icons for the conceptual “information”
