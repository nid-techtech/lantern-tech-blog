## Shape Writer

A single alphabet letter, a phonetic symbol, is merely a mark and holds no linguistic meaning on its own.

However, when letters gather and align according to rules, meaning emerges. Even with the same letters, a different arrangement alters their meaning.

This work expresses the process of creating words by combining symbols - alphabets.

When a viewer types words on a keyboard, the corresponding letters are summoned. The letters are pushed out by pistons and placed onto a conveyor. The conveyor moves the letters, and the next letter is placed.

Letter data entered from the keyboard is sent to Arduino via Unity.Arduino receives this data and controls servo motors and stepper motors accordingly.

This is the moment when "meaning," "words," and "language," which we usually take for granted, are born.

Witness the construction of symbols into language with your own eyes and re-examine "words."
