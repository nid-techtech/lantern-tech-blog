## Designing Character Path Data

`2025/06/28`

I designed the characters in Fusion.

Initially, I planned to import vectors designed in Illustrator into Fusion. However, I realized this would cause inaccuracies in dimensions. Therefore, I decided to do the opposite: export vectors designed in Fusion to Illustrator.

## Mass-Producing Characters

`2025/07/18`

I'm creating characters.

There are 26 types, so I'll run multiple 3D printers in parallel.

## Partially Redesigned Character

`2025/07/24`

A problem occurred where the letter 'Y' could not be ejected properly.

The cause was that, unlike other characters, 'Y' lacked a vertical outline that extended along the left and right boundaries, preventing the inner walls of the vendor from acting as a guideway and causing jams.

Therefore, it was redesigned from scratch.

## OpenType Font Creation

`2025/07/25`

I converted it into a font so it can be used on computers.

[Calligraphr](https://www.calligraphr.com/en) was used to create the font file.
