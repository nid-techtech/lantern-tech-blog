# Pythagora Device No.58 Conveyor

`Keio University, Sato Masahiko Laboratory | 2005`

**Display Size**

Unknown

**Materials & Equipment Used**

Cloth, wooden boards, acrylic sheets, dry cell batteries, marbles, desk, square timber (only for the conveyor mechanism section) 

**System Configuration**

Point 4: Conveyor

Boards pre-marked with “ピ,” “タ,” “ゴ,” and ‘ラ’ are stacked on the conveyor. A gate is positioned at the conveyor's exit, allowing only one board to pass through at a time. This causes the stacked boards to slide down, sequentially arranging the four letters “ピタゴラ.”

The conveyor's power source utilizes the force generated by weights attached to four dry cell batteries sliding down an incline.

(Sato Lab & EUPHRATES 2006:69)(1)

**Concept**

This is the Pythagora device, Device No. 58, created in 2005.

It consists of several mechanisms aligned with the theme: as the device progresses, previously absent elements appear and become functional.

- A string tied to a miniature car becomes taut as the car moves forward, then forms a rail for the ball to pass through.
- A flipped-up board has a small hole drilled in it; when a marble passes through it, the board falls, and a wire attached to a previously unseen board becomes a rail for the marble to travel on.
- As the conveyor moves, stacked wooden boards come into view from off-screen; passing through a gate transforms them into the title logo.

Pythagora devices frequently incorporate attempts where elements like marbles themselves control the device's state or behavior. This creates a visual surprise and sense of satisfaction for viewers watching the device's movement on TV, as they observe how the device's appearance has drastically changed from just seconds prior, yet it operates as if this transformation were entirely natural.

Notable examples include “Blazing My Own Trail” (2002/Device No. 27) and “Preemptive Capture” (2007/Device No. 87).


This “Conveyor” mechanism, as explained, “derives its name from the smooth movement of the cloth pulling out the four boards bearing the letters ‘ピ’, ‘タ’, ‘ゴ’, and ‘ラ’ for the finish, resembling a conveyor belt.” (Sato Lab & EUPHRATES 2006:69)(1) It iconically treats the part where the conveyor mechanism creates the title logo.

The program name “Pythagora Switch” is written in katakana. Katakana is a phonetic script; the characters themselves hold no linguistic meaning and only acquire meaning when arranged into strings. In “Conveyor,” the camera captures the moment linguistic information is born as the conveyor mechanism aligns the character panels one by one.

By prompting viewers to think, “What's this? A pile of stacked boards came along, and then it became the word ‘Pythagora’!” the work delivers a sense of exhilaration: the transformation from non-linguistic information, or information without linguistic meaning, into meaningful linguistic information.

Works sharing a similar concept include “Anagram Machine” (2005/Device No. 50), ‘Wiper’ (2006/Device No. 68), and “Fly Swatter Car” (2008/Device No. 95).

# Bit.Fall

`Julius Popp | 2006`

**Exhibition Dimensions**

Height: 8m Width: 6~7m Depth: 1~2m

Dimensions vary depending on the location.

**Materials & Equipment Used**

Solenoid valve: electrically controls the lid.

**System Configuration**

Uses solenoid valves to form characters.

Retrieves text from the internet, such as Twitter.

**Concept**

“Bit.Fall” is a liquid screen where each drop of water becomes a pixel.

The way and rate to which the drops of water collect allow to write letters and words scrolling like endless credits.

These fragile and short-lived signs become so many messages and random slogans fading one after the other.

These words directly taken from the world web in real time appear suddenly and fade away on the edge of the Loire river, on the borderline between visible and invisible.

# Text Rain

`Romy Achituv & Camille Utterback | 1999`

**Display Size**

Any screen size is acceptable.

(At SIGGRAPH 2000, a screen measuring approximately 4.5ft × 6ft was used.)

**Materials & Equipment**

Camera, projector, computer

**System Configuration**

Unknown

Believed to be achievable using tools like TouchDesigner.

**Concept**

"Text Rain" is an interactive installation in which viewers play with the falling text of a poem. The text responds to motion and can be caught, lifted and released to fall again. If participants accumulate enough letters along their outstretched arms, or along the silhouette of any dark object, they can read words and phrases formed by the falling letters. With active participation the text of the poem can be gradually reconstructed.

This work eloquently blurs the boundaries between the physical and virtual, echoing and complimenting the structure of the interactive experience within the piece.
