# Walkthrough - Remove Link Underline

I have removed the default underline from links as requested.

## Changes

### `src/styles/global.css`

-   Reverted `text-decoration` to `none` for the `a` selector.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
-   [x] **Link Style**: Verified that links no longer have an underline by default.
