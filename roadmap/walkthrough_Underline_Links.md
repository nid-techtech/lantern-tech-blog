# Walkthrough - Underline Links

I have updated the global CSS to ensure all links are underlined by default.

## Changes

### `src/styles/global.css`

-   Changed `text-decoration` from `none` to `underline` for the `a` selector.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
-   [x] **Link Style**: Verified that links now have `text-decoration: underline` applied globally.
